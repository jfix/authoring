In order to do this,
              each page of documentation provides information for just one specific XML element. As documentation is provided for several models, it is possible that the element
              you are looking for is used in more than one of those models; therefore, the information on the page is broken down for each model which uses the element you are interested in.</p><p>At the very top of the page, the name of the element is given, along with a list of the models which use that element.</p><img src="ex1.png" style="border: 1px solid #333333;"/><p>Beneath is a section for each distinct version of the component or element, with the model (or models) to which that version relates clearly shown.</p><img src="ex2.png" style="border: 1px solid #333333;"/><p>The information for each version shows a list of components/elements which can act as a 'parent' to this component/element, and if relevant with the name of the model to which that parent belongs.
              You can click on this element name to see details of that element, and you should be able to see how the child element relates to it.</p><img src="ex3.png" style="border: 1px solid #333333;"/><p>There may also be a diagram showing the possible child elements. You will see symbols representing choices of elements and sequences of elements.
              The model should be read from top to bottom; i.e. the first child available to this element is that nearest the top of the tree. You'll also notice some elements, choices and sequences have dashed
              line borders, indicating that they are not mandatory. They may also have numbers beneath them, indicating that an element, choice or sequence can be repeated more than once.</p><p>Rolling your mouse over any of the element names in the diagram will highlight that element - by clicking on it you will be taken to the definition of the element. <strong>When you click on an element
              in the diagram, you will be taken to the correct point in the subsequent page, i.e. the correct version of that element for the model you are interested in.</strong></p><img src="ex4.png" style="border: 1px solid #333333;"/><p>To the left of the screen is a list of all the elements available from all of the models. You can use this to jump straight to an element's documentation.However, if you do this <strong>be sure that you
            scroll to the correct version of the element as defined by the model it can be used in</strong> - the quickest and easiest way to see precisely the information you need is to click through from
            the diagram, as explained above, rather than using the links on the left.</p><p>Beneath the diagram may be a table containing a list of the attributes available to this element, along with some explanations as to their use. Optional attributes are shown in italics.</p><p>Beneath the attribute details may be a list of some more specific rules which should be considered for this element.</p><p>Finally, you may find some details as to the correct usage of this element and maybe some example XML.</p><p>Please note, that in order to view this documentation you should use a browser that supports SVG.</p></div><div id="right"/></div></body></html>
