About this directory structure
------------------------------

three directories:
* models 	-> for everything model/schema-related
* software	-> for everything quark-related
* tools		-> not used right now, but intended for shared tools (of any kind)

no new directories should be added unless agreed by all parties.

this approach should allow us to keep a clean separation between the models and the software parts of the project
