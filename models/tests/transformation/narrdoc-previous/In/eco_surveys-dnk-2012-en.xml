            <p id="ID64918fde-2c77-4d42-9dcc-770b59e6289e" numbering="n">The current international
                slowdown entails new risks for the Danish economy, which so far had been recovering
                only slowly and unevenly from the unwinding of a massive domestic property boom and
                the global crisis that erupted in 2007­08. The main challenge is to secure the
                necessary space for policies to cope with potential further adverse shocks by
                sticking to the current plans and to bring about strong, sustainable and greener
                growth. The economy displays a number of strengths. The fiscal position is
                relatively sound. The flexicurity system helps adjust to shocks while limiting the
                social cost of unemployment and the risk that it becomes entrenched. The welfare
                system ensures low poverty and inequality. However, competitiveness has deteriorated
                in the past decade and productivity growth has been weak, eroding potential growth.
                Moreover, vulnerabilities remain in the financial sector. Denmark’s green growth
                ambitions might translate into new sources of growth, but energy and climate change
                policies need to be reviewed to achieve better results at low cost.</p>

                        enhanced prudential tools, in line with developments at EU level, would
                        improve financial stability. Systemically important financial institutions
                        may need to be subjected to higher capital requirements. Issuance of new
                        deferred­amortisation mortgage loans should be closely supervised to
                        preserve the quality of the assets of mortgage issuers.</p>

                        institutions involved in competition policy and granting them more power
                        would improve their effectiveness.</p>

                        sustainability without raising the already high tax burden, which acts as a
                        drag on economic growth. This could be achieved by introducing multi­annual
                        spending ceilings at the general government level, covering most spending,
                        and broadening the Danish Economic Council’s fiscal monitoring mandate. To
                        ensure that individual municipalities are constrained by expenditure
                        ceilings covering all municipalities, the use of individual and credible
                        sanctions should continue.</p>

                        The reform of the early retirement scheme will increase labour supply and
                        strengthen the sustainability of the welfare system. Reducing the share of
                        the working­age population receiving sickness and disability benefits is
                        also crucial to achieve these goals. The authorities will have to ensure
                        that the new senior disability scheme does not lead to a greater uptake of
                        these benefits. The special disabled employment programme (<emphasis

                        particular by making it more targeted and less generous. The efficiency of
                        public spending on education and health care can be improved.</p>

                        the chances of adopting the best technologies and reduce the risks of costly
                        mistakes. It would be consistent with Denmark’s ambitious targets to push
                        for lower emissions caps in future EU negotiations. Hiking some taxes on
                        fossil fuels would help harmonise the implicit price of carbon and encourage
                        GHG emission cuts in the transport and residential sector. Efforts to cut

                partly recovered from the global crisis that erupted in 2007­08 and from the
                unwinding of a massive domestic property boom, and now faces weakening global
                activity and confidence amidst acute uncertainty surrounding the euro area crisis.
                The new government has to make sure it has sufficient leeway to cope with a
                potential further deterioration in global economic conditions while in a longer­run
                perspective promoting strong, sustainable and green growth. Denmark’s fiscal, labour
                market and well­being indicators compare favourably with those in many other
                OECD countries, but productivity growth has long been anaemic and weaknesses remain
                in the financial sector. Implementing policies to achieve the new government’s
                ambitious goal to raise labour supply is also a key part of the solution.</p>

                thereby making room to deal with future shocks and to avoid increases in the tax
                pressure, which acts as a drag on productivity growth (<xref

                would limit short­term risks and policies should be in place to prevent any future
                resurgence of the housing market imbalances that contributed to weakening
                productivity growth in the 2000s. Denmark is focused resolutely on green growth and
                plans to become independent from fossil fuels by 2050 (<xref

                visionary and it may allow Denmark to benefit from potential new sources of growth.
                However, as it is also likely to entail substantial economic costs, energy and
                climate change policies need to be designed efficiently.</p>

                    of strong but overleveraged growth, the Danish economy started to slow down
                    in 2007 due to binding capacity constraints, eroding competitiveness and the
                    unwinding of a major property boom. This slowdown was amplified in 2008 by the
                    global crisis as exports collapsed in the face of shrinking foreign demand and
                    the financial sector experienced problems. Taking advantage of the country’s
                    fiscal wherewithal, the authorities took swift action, easing the macroeconomic
                    policy stance and offering support to the banking system. Even so, Denmark
                    endured an unprecedented economic contraction, with output down by 7.9% from the
                    unsustainably high peak to the trough (<xref

                    employment fell abruptly, especially in construction. The increase in
                    unemployment has not been reversed and it remained at 7.4% of the labour force
                    in the third quarter of 2011 (on the harmonised measure). Long­term unemployment
                    has also risen, and accounted for 23% of unemployment in the third quarter of
                    2011, which, however, remains low in historical and international

                    not fully recovered from the property collapse and the global economic crisis
                    when renewed economic weakness became apparent in 2011. Following the May 2010
                    Fiscal Consolidation Agreement, it had been hoped that growth would gradually
                    rely more on private domestic demand and exports. However, stagnant private
                    consumption and lower­than­expected export growth made for a muted recovery
                    through mid­2011 (<xref refid="IDbf2a4ced-915b-4c64-9041-3e59fb84179f"

                    renewed global slowdown will depress exports and delay the hoped­for pick­up in
                    investment and private consumption. Competitiveness has deteriorated markedly
                    since 2000 and the recent improvements were not sufficient to fully reverse
                    previous losses (<xref refid="ID727af3de-2ff7-4370-a853-781fd160c782"

                    However, terms­of­trade gains and a large surplus in the current account over
                    the past 20 years may reflect better performance in terms of non­price
                    competitiveness. Nevertheless, wage moderation will have to continue. The new
                    stimulus package, mainly in the form of public investment, and the pay­out of
                    contributions from the early retirement scheme as part of its reform (see
                    below), will boost economic activity in 2012. Exports are expected to benefit
                    from a pick­up in world trade in 2013 and the labour market should improve
                    slightly. However, fiscal consolidation is projected to damp private demand and
                    the recovery is likely to remain subdued in 2013.</p>

                    been subject to appreciation pressures in recent months as a consequence of
                    flight to quality, pushing ten­year government bond yields below Germany’s. This
                    has led the Danish National Bank (DNB), whose objective is to maintain a peg to
                    the euro, to intervene in foreign exchange markets on various occasions.
                    Accordingly, foreign­exchange reserves rose by 12% between January and
                    December 2011, to 31% of annual GDP. The DNB cut its key lending rate by
                    35 basis points in early November 2011, to 1.2%, bringing it 5 basis points
                    below the ECB’s, and then twice in December 2011, to 0.7%, bringing it 30 basis
                    points below the ECB’s. Going forward, the economy will continue to be supported
                    by low interest rates, which are expected to decrease even further, in line with
                    developments in the euro area.</p>

                    fiscal and monetary policies, there are many downside risks to economic growth.
                    A sharper­than­expected slowdown in Denmark’s partner economies, would further
                    depress exports. This in turn could worsen loan impairments in the corporate
                    sector, putting pressure on the financial sector. Some small banks are
                    especially exposed to agriculture, which faces high debt, falling land prices
                    and funding problems. Moreover, if global financial conditions were to
                    deteriorate further, leading to liquidity shortages, banks might restrict
                    lending to the corporate sector. This would make it especially difficult for
                    small and medium­sized enterprises, which already face stricter lending
                    conditions, to access funding and would depress growth even further.</p>

                        type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). Since then, households have been
                    taking advantage of the 2009 tax cuts and low interest rates to rebuild their
                    savings, but this nevertheless led to subdued private consumption. The pay­out
                    of contributions to the early retirement scheme due to its reform will give a
                    one­off boost to household disposable income and thus should sustain private
                    consumption in 2012, although households are expected to continue to deleverage.
                    Household assets are also high. A major portion of these, notably pension
                    rights, is illiquid, while household debt largely consists of mortgage loans.
                    Households thus remain exposed to labour market, housing market or other shocks.
                    Non­performing loans have not been a major problem for mortgage issuers’ balance
                    sheets during the crisis as legal arrangements in Denmark strongly encourage
                    loan repayment. However, further increases in unemployment and a fall in house
                    prices would raise risks of losses for the financial system, which may in turn
                    lead to a reduction of lending to households. While the house price slide
                    essentially stopped in 2010, the real estate market has shown signs of further
                    deterioration in 2011, with transactions falling anew.</p>

                    the easing of the fiscal stance in 2012 is appropriate but it needs to be
                    accompanied by measures to consolidate public finances in the longer term in
                    line with the EU Stability and Growth Pact requirements and the 2020 budget
                    balance target. In the event of a dramatic further deterioration in global
                    conditions, however, Danish policy options would be influenced by the reaction
                    of other economies and the state of international financial markets, and the
                    potential benefits of fiscal expansion to support activity will have to be
                    balanced against the need to safeguard the credibility of fiscal policy.</p>
                <p id="ID8e725513-d753-477d-81ba-f239448d3699" numbering="n">In any case, pushing
                    ahead with structural reform is necessary to secure the leeway to cope with the
                    ongoing slowdown and with further potential adverse shocks. In December 2011,
                    the Parliament adopted the agreement signed between the previous government and
                    other parties to reform the early retirement scheme, which allowed workers to
                    leave the labour market at age 60, explaining why employment rates are
                    relatively low for workers above that age, even though they are much above the
                    OECD average for other age groups. The reform shortens the scheme’s duration and
                    brings forward the decision adopted in the 2006 Welfare Agreement to raise the
                    retirement age. The implementation of this reform will significantly improve

                    low unemployment and high employment but it may be tested by prolonged periods
                    of low labour demand. It has been argued that low job protection has contributed
                    to weak productivity growth by discouraging investment in firm­specific human
                    capital (IMF, 2010). However, the equal treatment of workers on temporary and
                    permanent contracts, which leads to low duality, minimises the risk that workers
                    most in need of training do not receive it. Furthermore, job protection affects
                    productivity growth through various channels (Bassanini <emphasis emph="italic"
                        >et</emphasis> <emphasis emph="italic">al.</emphasis>, 2009). In particular,
                    low job protection helps firms adapt to the cycle and to technological progress,
                    and encourages them to use labour and capital efficiently (Hopenhayn and
                    Rogerson, 1993). In any case, Danish hiring and firing regulations were already
                    in place in the 1990s when the productivity gap relative to leading OECD
                    countries was narrowing.</p>

                    material conditions and quality of life is very high (OECD, 2011a). In

                    (OECD, 2009). Some restrictive regulations in retail, such as zoning laws,
                    prevent the exploitation of economies of scale through hypermarkets. The Package
                    also aims to increase competition for public contracts. There has been an
                    improvement in the tendering process in recent years and private provision of
                    local public services has increased, but it can expand further. There is some
                    choice of public and private providers of welfare services. For example, in
                    2009, one third of the assistance to elderly and disabled persons was provided
                    by the private sector (Danish Competition Authority, 2010). Even so, regulations
                    are quite restrictive in this area and private involvement would improve
                    incentives to innovate and raise productivity.</p>

                    involved in competition issues, which weakens the effectiveness and enforcement
                    powers of the overall competition framework. The Danish Competition and Consumer
                    Authority (DCCA), which is the main regulator, was made more effective in
                    April 2010 as merger control was strengthened by lowering the thresholds of
                    merger notifications, simplifying the procedures for handling unproblematic
                    mergers and extending the time limits for the handling of problematic ones
                    (OECD, 2010c). However, the two­tier system of the Competition Council (which
                    also has a number of powers including to grant and revoke individual exemptions,
                    review mergers and certify that conduct is not anti­competitive) and the Appeals
                    Tribunal (which acts as a check on Council and Authority decisions before they
                    get appealed to the regular court) may undermine decisions made by the
                    Competition Authority (OECD, 2005). The inclusion of representatives from
                    industry and consumers in the Competition Council, its lack of power to directly
                    prosecute and impose fines and weak sanctions (low fines and no possibility of
                    imprisonment) may undermine its effectiveness.</p>

                    system features a large number of small banks and a couple of banks that are
                        <shortcitation>too big to fail</shortcitation> with one of them being
                    classified as a global systemically­important financial institution by the
                    Financial Stability Board. The two types of banks create different
                    vulnerabilities, which need to be addressed in line with supervisory
                    developments at the European Union level. In response to the global financial
                    crisis, Denmark took numerous measures to support its banking system, including
                    the provision of capital injections, guarantees and extra liquidity
                    (OECD, 2009). Denmark has since replaced its blanket debt guarantee, and
                    introduced a special resolution regime (which was used for Amagerbanken in
                    February 2011 and Fjordbank Mors in June 2011). These measures, which prevent
                    moral hazard, put Denmark ahead of other countries that were still working to
                    replace extraordinary public support provided to the financial system during the
                    crisis. In response to renewed pressures in global financial markets, some new
                    support mechanisms were introduced in August 2011, including the expansion of
                    collateral accepted by the Danish National Bank (DNB).</p>

                        to 121 by mid­2011 as some of these small banks were merged or closed
                        without endangering the financial system, given their size. After the expiry
                        of the state guarantee, faced with the challenge of refinancing debt in
                        2012­13, smaller banks might have trouble accessing credit markets. Closure
                        of small banks that cannot operate effectively without unconditional public
                        support will lead to a more efficient banking structure. The set of new

                        systemically­important financial institution (SIFI) is not clear, but Bank
                        Package IV has rightly put SIFI supervision on the agenda. Developments in
                        the supervision of global SIFIs can provide guidelines in this process
                        (Financial Stability Board, 2011). The recent global crisis has shown that
                        an overly large banking sector (as measured by assets to GDP) in general and
                        SIFIs in particular can be dangerous for small countries. Many of them are
                        addressing these issues, for example through higher contingent capital
                        requirements on SIFIs in Switzerland. Denmark’s experience in the early
                        1990s, when the banking crisis did not become systemic thanks to Danish
                        banks’ large capital and reserves, unlike in the other Nordic economies,
                        illustrates the merits of adequate buffers (Vastrup, 2002). It is important
                        to balance the need for banks to bolster their capital in the new
                        supervisory environment, and the role they should play in shouldering the
                        liabilities that a financial crisis can impose on public finances. This
                        could be achieved by setting up a reserve which would be available in the
                        event of future crises to assist financial institutions, especially SIFIs,
                        along the lines of Sweden’s Stabilisation Fund (Schich and Kim, 2010). The
                        Danish government currently maintains an on­demand deposit with the central
                        bank of 14% of GDP, which could be drawn upon in such circumstances.</p>

                        introduced a new tool to monitor the riskiness of individual banks, dubbed
                        the <shortcitation>supervisory diamond</shortcitation> (whose facets include
                        large exposures, lending growth, a funding ratio, concentration on
                        commercial property and liquidity ratios). The Danish supervisory diamond
                        could be adjusted to take into account more of the risks to the financial
                        system from external sources, as done in Norway, where a similar tool has
                        been introduced. Further enhancement of cross­border financial supervision
                        co­ordination and co­operation through the Nordic­Baltic Memorandum of
                        Understanding, especially on the resolution of cross­border institutions,
                        would also contribute to financial stability.</p>

                        authorities are also working to address the challenges Danish banks will
                        face in the implementation of the Basel III rules, which needs to be carried
                        out as soon as feasible. The two proposed liquidity measures, the net stable
                        funding ratio (NSFR) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), will help make
                        mortgage markets more stable. Depending on how the NSFR is implemented in
                        the European capital requirement directive, it may limit the use of
                        shorter­term bonds to finance variable­rate mortgages.</p>
                    <p id="ID4409e4e9-2a4b-43a1-96b1-5d095c2fc62b" numbering="n">Given that Danish
                        covered bonds have proved to be as liquid as government bonds in the recent
                        crisis (Boucholst, 2010), the authorities argue for treating the two on an
                        equal footing for the purposes of the LCR (DNB, 2011). If that is done, it
                        becomes even more important that the mortgage market is monitored closely.
                        Adjustable­rate and deferred­amortisation mortgage loans have fuelled house
                        price exuberance prior to the crisis (Danish Economic Council, 2008;
                        DNB, 2010). These loans, especially when accompanied by excessive
                        loan­to­value ratios, could be a source of weakness if they are given to
                        households who could not easily service their debt if interest rates
                        increased sharply or house prices fell. Therefore, they should be closely
                        supervised, including by monitoring the implementation of the requirement
                        that the borrower can show they can afford the corresponding fixed­rate loan
                        instalments. The ongoing efforts to improve data collection on the
                        characteristics of the users of different types of loans will provide more
                        information to the supervisory authorities. Once the housing market
                        recovers, more stringent caps on loan­to­value or loan­to­income ratios for
                        such loans could be introduced.</p>

                    social security burden on labour, taxes on labour remain high compared with
                    other OECD countries (OECD, 2009, 2011b). In particular, the highest marginal
                    tax rate enters into force at relatively low levels of income, leading to high
                    marginal tax wedges for incomes just above the average. This is not conducive to
                    entrepreneurship and reduces Denmark’s attractiveness to foreign skilled
                    workers, thereby exerting a drag on productivity growth. It also diminishes the
                    attractiveness of higher education. High marginal tax rates, better work
                    conditions in the public sector and relatively moderate wage dispersion may have
                    discouraged skilled workers from taking jobs with high productivity growth
                    potential in the private sector. Furthermore, high marginal tax rates on incomes
                    just above the average reduce hours worked. Against this backdrop, the new

                    marginal tax rates on income, the tax structure is generally sound, with
                    relatively high indirect taxes and low corporate taxes, room to adjust the tax
                    structure is limited (Arnold <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011).
                    Nevertheless, part of the tax burden could be switched from labour to property
                    and environmental externalities (see below). Property value taxes have been
                    frozen in nominal terms since 2002. Raising taxation on property, by restoring
                    the tax base once the housing market has stabilised, could limit the risk of
                    future housing booms and would partly offset the distributional effects of
                    reducing taxes on higher incomes, either through an increase in the tax
                    threshold for the top personal income tax rate or a decrease in the marginal tax
                    rate. Indirect taxes on unhealthy products have been raised recently and will be
                    increased further in 2012­13. Denmark is the first country to have introduced a
                        <shortcitation>fat tax</shortcitation>. Such increases contribute to making
                    room over the longer term for enhancing the efficiency of the tax structure by
                    reducing taxes on income. Their effect on health and their distributional impact
                    should be monitored in the near future.</p>

                        to be reinforced, both at the central and sub­central levels</mainhead>

                <p id="IDcaaa79e8-c6e2-4ed2-ab1f-3eb2dae3aac4" numbering="n">In many respects, the
                    Danish fiscal framework looks sound, with governments setting various targets
                    and regularly preparing medium­term plans. Overall, there is a worthy tradition
                    of focusing on long­term issues, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> under
                    the aegis of the Danish Economic Council and various commissions. The main
                    targets covering the structural balance and long­term fiscal sustainability have
                    generally been met. However, in the past, governments have often missed targets
                    for public expenditure. These failures point to the need to address the core of
                    the problem, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e</emphasis>. to have spending targets
                    that are enforced and the associated requirement to improve fiscal relations
                    between levels of government.</p>
                <p id="ID851cd6b7-d28d-48c9-a254-f8a449e07f81" numbering="n">The medium­term targets
                    lack strong legal backing and, as slippage triggers no corrective mechanisms,
                    they are weakly enforced. The new government has recently proposed to introduce
                    expenditure ceilings anchored in a law, one for each level of government (state,
                    regions and municipalities), which is an important step in the right direction.
                    It is advisable that expenditure ceilings cover most public spending, not only
                    public consumption as is currently the case, though perhaps excluding investment
                    and cyclically­sensitive spending such as unemployment benefits, and all levels
                    of government.</p>

                    experience suggests that fiscal councils can help prevent slippage and more
                    generally improve fiscal performance (Hagemann, 2010).<emphasis emph="bold"
                    > </emphasis>Denmark has a long experience in this area with the Danish Economic
                    Council since 1962 and the Environmental Economic Council since 2007 – which are
                    both headed by independent chairpersons. The Economic Council provides analysis
                    and recommendations twice a year on a broad range of issues including fiscal and
                    labour market ones. It could play an even stronger role as a fiscal council if
                    its mandate in this area were broadened, and if it were granted access to the
                    data needed to thoroughly assess budgetary targets and outcomes.</p>
                <p id="ID338dab55-e7fb-432d-8094-97ca75e9cb91" numbering="n">Expenditure slippage
                    has mostly stemmed from difficulties in controlling public expenditure at the
                    sub­central level, especially in the case of municipalities. More than 60% of
                    public expenditure is decentralised, meaning that sub­central public expenditure
                    as a share of GDP is greater than total public expenditure in Australia or
                    Switzerland. It is therefore crucial to have a framework to control it while
                    ensuring sufficient sub­central government independence. The Danish framework
                    rests on negotiations between the central level and an association representing
                    municipalities on a broad range of issues, including expenditure targets and the
                    level of grants they receive from the central level. This framework suffers from
                    two major weaknesses:</p>

                            relatively soft budget constraint for municipalities, which do not feel

                            until recently, there were no sanctions. The <shortcitation>tax
                                freeze</shortcitation> imposed some limits on tax increases, but
                            failed to contain public expenditures as municipalities have found other
                            sources of revenues, including by drawing down their savings, and state
                            grants were raised to finance overruns of spending.</p>

                            for a significant share of municipalities’ revenues (around 40%). Hence,
                            although at the margin each municipality has to finance higher service
                            spending fully out of its own revenues, the link between the cost borne
                            by taxpayers and the benefits of public services may be less visible,
                            creating pressure for more spending (Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003). The
                            power of municipalities over some transfer spending is also relatively
                            weak, as the central government sets many regulations. The central
                            government becomes partly responsible, at least implicitly, for the
                            quality of services provided at the local level and may be asked to
                            intervene when service provision is under pressure, which in turn
                            generates expectations at the local level that their fiscal problems
                            will be solved.</p>

                <p id="ID4a851c13-4661-49e5-b5b1-e54e7cccf930" numbering="n">The 2010 Fiscal
                    Consolidation Plan contained measures to better control municipalities’
                    expenditures, including the possibility to cut the grants if expenditures were
                    to increase more than agreed upon, sanctions for municipalities that raised
                    their tax rates beyond the agreed limits and some rules for adjustment in case
                    of slippage. These measures go in the right direction and seem to have
                    contributed to containing public consumption growth in the very recent past.
                    However, it is too early to assess their full effectiveness and therefore, the
                    authorities will have to remain vigilant and be ready to tighten sanctions if
                    slippages are observed. An overall ceiling on local public expenditure with a
                    legal status, as announced by the previous and again the new government, would
                    give more credibility to these sanctions. To ensure that individual
                    municipalities feel constrained by rules covering all of them, negotiations on
                    the distribution of individual expenditure ceilings and grants should ensure
                    compliance with the overall ceiling. Municipalities that overrun the ceiling
                    should continue to be penalised and to have to present a plan to offset the
                    slippage in the following years. A system of tradable municipal rights, limiting
                    overall municipalities’ expenditures to the amount of
                        <shortcitation>rights</shortcitation> and allowing municipalities to buy or
                    sell these rights depending on their expenditure needs, could also conceivably
                    be introduced.</p>

                    ceilings should help prevent slippages. If they were to fail to contain local
                    public expenditures, consideration should be given to raising the share of taxes
                    in municipal revenues and to limiting the sharing of responsibilities so as to
                    help prevent spending and taxes from rising beyond voters’ choices. Grants could
                    be reduced to encourage municipalities to realise the economies of scale that
                    the merging of municipalities in 2007 was supposed to generate and to raise the
                    efficiency of their expenditures. </p>

                        should aim at helping the sick and disabled with sufficient ability to work
                        to find ordinary employment. In particular, the special disabled employment
                        programme (<emphasis emph="italic">Fleksjob</emphasis>) should be
                        reconsidered as it has led to an increase in the overall number of
                        recipients of these programmes. It should be made less generous as the
                        income can be higher than the previous wage, and more targeted to
                        individuals in need. A plan to reform the special disabled employment
                        programme following these lines was proposed in April 2011 but reforms have
                        been postponed since then (Danish Government, 2011a).</p>

                        to improve and develop the evaluation and assessment framework, in

                        business demand is relatively low (OECD, 2009; Growth Forum, 2011).
                        Confining the duration of grants to the normal length of study would push
                        students to complete their curriculum faster. Gradually moving to a system

                        income­contingent loans could be considered that encourages students to take
                        earning prospects after graduation more into account when making study

                        a lower cost (Joumard <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). The

                        once granted, subsidies can be very difficult to withdraw, even when the
                        initial justification no longer applies, and rents tend to be captured by

                        justified by differences in cost structures and maturity of technologies. In
                        the absence of such justification, subsidies should be made more uniform

                        implicit carbon price. In the transport sector, various taxes apply, on top
                        of carbon and energy taxes, including a motor vehicle registration tax,
                        which depends on the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, with electric cars to
                        be exempted until 2015 (the basic rate is 105% on the value of the car below
                        EUR 10 000 and 180% above this threshold). This vehicle tax provides a
                        one­off incentive to purchase a less emitting car but no incentive for
                        further abatement after the purchase (OECD, 2010d). Furthermore, the high

                        EU­wide instrument to limit these emissions would be a first best. At the EU
                        level, Denmark could push for the adoption of policies that indirectly put a
                        price on these emissions, one imperfect option being to tax agriculture
                        inputs. </p>

                                            in 2011, the entry age to this programme has increased
                                            by four years (up from two years as planned previously)
                                            and this increase is brought forward by five years to
                                            start in 2014. As previously agreed, the national
                                            old­age pension age has been raised by two years from 65
                                            to 67, but this rise is also brought forward by five
                                            years to start in 2019. Further increases in both of
                                            these entry ages will take place in line with increases
                                            in life expectancy, as previously agreed. </p>

                    country with sound public finances. Public debt and the deficit are relatively
                    low. So is the foreseeable impact of ageing on public finances compared with
                    many other OECD countries. Nevertheless, the very high level of public
                    expenditures and hence, of taxes, as well as difficulties in controlling these
                    expenditures, have negative effects on the economy and could threaten public
                    finances in the longer run. Consolidating public finances would require
                    addressing the core of the problem, which partly lies in the fiscal relations
                    between levels of government. There is also room to increase the efficiency of
                    public spending in some areas such as health and education.</p>

            <p id="ID5826de92-bab1-408d-9fb1-e118c5fa0ad0" numbering="n">Denmark’s public finances
                are sound compared with many other OECD countries. The debt­to­GDP ratio increased
                during the economic and financial crisis, but remains well below the 60% EU ceiling.
                The fiscal deficit, close to 4% of GDP in 2011, is far below the EU and OECD
                averages. Going forward, the impact of ageing is expected to be limited, partly
                because the pension age has already been indexed to life expectancy. A Consolidation
                Agreement plan was introduced in 2010 and the newly elected government has announced
                it will comply with EU commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
            <p id="ID99f10c37-5546-4c23-83ba-3dc0a91c25d2" numbering="n">Nevertheless, Denmark faces
                a number of fiscal challenges. The global crisis led to an increase in government
                outlays, which are now the highest in the OECD as a share of GDP. This is not
                necessarily a problem <emphasis emph="italic">per se</emphasis>, but it implies a
                heavy tax burden and past experience shows that Denmark has often failed to control
                public expenditures, including in times of strong economic growth. To finance these
                large expenditures, the tax burden has to be high – the highest among OECD
                countries. The large size of the public sector and high taxes, especially on labour,
                have negative effects for the economy, contributing to relatively weak productivity
                growth although the mix of expenditures can to some extent mitigate this negative
                effect (Cook <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011; Bassanini <emphasis
                    emph="italic">et</emphasis> <emphasis emph="italic">al.</emphasis>, 2001).</p>
            <p id="ID05b17330-3fca-488b-bf42-1ca0e0076161" numbering="n">Consolidating public
                finances in Denmark appears at first sight to require only moderate efforts: the
                deficit is not large, there are margins to reduce public expenditure at a relatively
                low social cost and there is some consensus for reducing at least some of these
                expenditures. However, past efforts to contain public expenditure have failed,
                suggesting that the problem does not stem from a lack of plans and targets but from
                weak implementation. This chapter sets out ways to consolidate public finances in
                Denmark by addressing the core of the problem, which mainly lies in the fiscal
                relations between levels of government. The chapter also discusses how to boost the
                efficiency of public spending and to improve the tax system. Reforms along these
                lines should help Denmark reduce the growth­inhibiting effects of high taxation.</p>

                    Denmark’s current public finance position compares favourably with most other
                    OECD countries with a debt­to­GDP ratio below 50% and a general government
                    deficit at less than 3% of GDP in 2010. This is largely because Denmark built up
                    sizeable general government surpluses in the 2000s, following earlier spells of
                    fiscal stress (<xref refid="ID4db0c220-e739-4bd6-8d25-e0fe276aed83" capital="no"

                    situation has deteriorated substantially during the current crisis, but as
                    Denmark entered the crisis in a strong position, the budget deficit has remained
                    moderate both compared to Denmark’s past experience and to other OECD countries.
                    The deterioration primarily reflected a large increase in public expenditure,
                    due to both relatively large automatic stabilisers and discretionary measures,
                    from already high levels. Indeed, Denmark failed to take advantage of buoyant
                    economic times to bring spending down. Concomitantly, tax pressure remained very
                    high, with ample revenues from North Sea oil and gas contributing to large
                    budget surpluses.</p>

                                    large size of the public sector may have led to some labour
                                    misallocation. The public sector employs a relatively large
                                    share of highly­educated workers (Danish Economic
                                    Council, 2010a). High marginal tax rates, better work conditions
                                    in the public sector and relatively moderate wage dispersion may
                                    have discouraged skilled workers from taking jobs with high
                                    productivity growth potential in the private sector. It can also
                                    be argued that, given high tax rates, students don’t face strong
                                    incentives to undertake courses in more promising but also more
                                    demanding fields. The ensuing misallocation of skilled workers
                                    in the economy may partly explain the weak Danish productivity
                                    growth (OECD, 2009), especially in an era of globalisation that
                                    makes it even more important to develop highly skilled and

                                    is the case for instance of the health sector, in which the
                                    dominance of public sector provision can reduce incentives to

                    Denmark will face additional public finance pressures. Spending related to
                    population ageing and health care will rise, though less than in many other OECD
                    countries (European Commission, 2009; IMF, 2010). Overall, population ageing is
                    expected to be limited compared to other EU countries, but it is already well
                    advanced, with the peak of the working­age population likely reached in 2009 and
                    a marked ageing of the population expected for the next two decades.
                    Furthermore, while Denmark has benefited from migration inflows at times when
                    the unemployment rate was very low, immigration could be less important in
                    future as neighbouring countries such as Germany and Sweden, also age. Revenues
                    from North Sea petroleum, which amounted to 1.6% of GDP per year on average over
                    2004­09, are expected to decline sharply after 2040.</p>

                    introduced to consolidate public finances and to limit public debt accumulation
                    to prudent levels. The May 2010 Fiscal Consolidation Agreement, which included a
                    plan to have zero growth in public consumption in real terms for 2011­13, was to
                    improve the structural balance by 1.5% of GDP over this period. Furthermore,
                    the adoption in December 2011 of the reform of the voluntary early retirement
                    programmes significantly improves long­term public finances (see below).
                    However, in its Budget Bill for 2012, the new government has announced some
                    increases in public expenditures that would require raising taxes further to
                    meet the EU commitment for 2013 (under the excessive deficit procedure) and its
                    target to have a structural fiscal balance by 2020.</p>

                    expenditure control is called for to avoid the size of the public sector being
                    too much of a drag on economic growth. Public expenditure rose markedly during
                    the crisis and was around 58% of GDP in 2011. Just returning to the pre­crisis
                    public expenditure­to­GDP ratio would necessitate a major adjustment in spending
                    growth. Taking measures to better control public expenditure and to consolidate
                    public finances in the longer term would leave room for short­term policy
                    action, such as the fiscal stimulus presented by the new government. In fact, it
                    would enhance its effectiveness in so far as Ricardian equivalence effects are
                    less potent when the government is seen to have a better grip on public
                    spending, so that firms and households anticipate that more spending today will
                    be financed by less spending in good times rather than by higher taxes

                    gradually formalising and strengthening its policy framework since the early
                    1990s. The EU deficit and debt norms and the requirement to provide a
                    convergence programme were a first step. In 1997, the government published its
                    first medium­term plan, <emphasis emph="italic">Denmark 2005</emphasis>, which
                    included fiscal targets and various labour market and social policy goals. Since
                    then, the government has presented regular medium­term fiscal programmes with
                    targets for the debt­to­GDP ratio, the structural budget balance and real public
                    consumption growth, the latest one being the <emphasis emph="italic">2020 Fiscal
                        Strategy</emphasis> (released in early 2011). In addition, there is a long
                    tradition of focusing on long­term issues, notably under the aegis of the Danish
                    Economic Council and various commissions including the Growth Forum.</p>

                    generally seems strong: it is transparent, looks at a medium­to­long­term
                    horizon, and combines budget and expenditure rules that are generally found to
                    be most effective for fiscal consolidation (Ayuso­i­Casala <emphasis

                        Guichard <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2007). Nevertheless,
                    fiscal outcomes have been mixed. The main targets covering the structural
                    balance and long­term fiscal sustainability have generally been met. However,
                    public consumption real growth targets have been systematically overshot, so
                    that, by 2007, the share of public consumption in GDP was 3 percentage points
                    above the target implied by the successive medium­term frameworks. The gaps
                    between outcomes and targets suggest that the fiscal framework should be
                    strengthened.</p>

                    valuation plus 5%. The main advantages of the tax freeze were its simplicity and
                    that it may have acted as a disciplining device. However, it failed to contain
                    public expenditures, even though they might have grown faster in the absence of
                    the tax freeze. The failure of the tax freeze partly comes from weaknesses of
                    the instrument. A tax freeze may in fact hinder tax cuts insofar as governments
                    may be reluctant to lower tax rates knowing that the tax freeze will make it
                    difficult to raise them in the future. Another weakness of a tax freeze is that
                    it may lock inefficiencies into the tax structure, by making it impossible to
                    raise efficient taxes while leaving inefficient ones in place, even if the
                    result is revenue neutral. For instance, it has led to low property taxes, which
                    contributed to the housing market boom (see below). The Budget Bill for 2012 has
                    effectively put an end to the tax freeze with increases in indirect taxes while
                    the property value tax will continue to be frozen (<xref

                <p id="ID05b6b9c2-42ec-4904-b8ac-53d1d861dd57" numbering="n">Some features of the
                    Danish political system may have contributed to the weak enforcement of fiscal
                    rules. The election process, since it determines the extent to which
                    policymakers will be held responsible for their actions, can play an important
                    role in fiscal outcomes (von Hagen, 2002). The Danish election system rests on
                    proportional representation, which tends to lead to higher levels of general
                    public goods than plurality voting systems (Persson and Tabellini, 1999). This
                    is because proportional representation weakens personal accountability, as
                    voters can assess only the average performance of all candidates elected from
                    the party list. Another important feature of the Danish system is that most
                    governments have been coalition governments, which favours cross­party
                    compromises on policies.</p>
                <p id="ID067a6456-689c-485c-8d56-db45bd9b3c78" numbering="n">Against this backdrop,
                    it is particularly important to have mechanisms that ensure enforcement of
                    fiscal rules. A centralised and transparent budget process may help
                    (von Hagen, 2002). Also, the probability of meeting fiscal rules is greater when
                    they have a legal basis with no margin for adjusting the objectives, are
                    monitored by independent authorities and by the media and include automatic
                    correction and sanction mechanisms in case of non­compliance (European
                    Commission, 2006 and Ayuso­i­Casals <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>,
                    2007).</p>

                    recently proposed to introduce expenditure ceilings anchored into a law, one for
                    each level of government (state, regions and municipalities), which is a step in
                    the right direction and should help avoid fiscal slippages (<xref
                        refid="ID6a3d9ed4-8fc2-470b-a088-473d37b1005c" capital="no" object="box"
                        type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). These expenditure ceilings should
                    cover a medium­term horizon and include most public spending (not only public
                    consumption) though perhaps excluding investment and cyclically­sensitive
                    spending such as unemployment benefits. It is also important to have mechanisms
                    to correct for deviations from the intended path. Prioritising public
                    expenditures can help here by providing a basis for postponing or giving up some
                    expenditures. In Sweden for instance, expenditures are ranked according to their
                    costs and benefits and any increases are examined in relation to the fiscal
                    space associated with the expenditure ceiling and the surplus target (Swedish
                    Ministry of Finance, 2011). This can also help limit the risk that temporary
                    increases in revenues lead to permanent increases in spending. Having public
                    expenditure ceilings with strong enforcement mechanisms is particularly
                    important for Denmark given its large and volatile revenues (from taxes on North
                    Sea oil production and on pension fund earnings). Entrusting the Danish Economic
                    Council more explicitly with the assessment of long­term fiscal sustainability
                    and the fulfilment of expenditure ceilings and giving it broad access to the
                    needed data would also help contain public expenditure growth. </p>

                        municipalities increased as a number of responsibilities were gradually
                        decentralised, but expenditure increases went beyond what the government had
                        been expecting. This occurred despite fiscal rules for municipalities,
                        including a prohibition on borrowing and a balanced budget requirement
                            (Sutherland <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2005) as
                        municipalities used other sources of revenue such as own land. Moreover,
                        while spending ceilings are negotiated with the central government (see
                        below), they have consistently been exceeded in the past two decades. In
                        addition to these rules, the central government has made various attempts to
                        control sub­central outlays. In 2003, as part of the <shortcitation>tax
                            freeze</shortcitation> introduced in 2001, municipalities were
                        henceforth forbidden from collectively raising the average tax rate, with
                        hikes in individual municipalities’ tax rate having to be offset by cuts in
                        other municipalities. This contrasts with the previous situation, where
                        local governments had the right to fix their own tax rates.</p>
                    <p id="IDd788db20-91ea-44dc-b346-772b7c0fbd66" numbering="n">In 2007, a major
                        institutional reform merged municipalities (reducing their number from 271
                        to 98), replaced the 13 counties by five regions, re­allocated tasks across
                        levels of government, and changed financing and equalisation rules. The main
                        objective was to adapt public service delivery to technological change and
                        increasing demand (some small municipalities being unable to provide some
                        social services). Nevertheless, the reform was also expected to contain
                        expenditure by fostering economies of scale, though the government was
                        recognised that such mergers might temporally push up expenditure (Ministry
                        of Interior and Health, 2005). Municipalities have had to bear the costs of
                        the mergers but were allowed to borrow to finance them and could keep the
                        gains. For the moment, the reform has resulted in an increase in grants from
                        the central government to finance services transferred to municipalities and
                        regions (Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2012). For the reform to be cost­neutral,
                        these additional costs will have to be compensated by future savings
                        generated by the new set­up.</p>

                        with the share of people older than 65 on the rise. Furthermore, as
                        productivity gains may be limited in some of these services (such as
                        long­term care), employers may have to raise wages beyond productivity gains
                        to attract workers, putting pressures on municipalities’ expenditures. This
                        factor may have played a role in Denmark, where unemployment fell
                        significantly during the 15 years preceding the crisis, with some tight
                        labour market spells. The 2007 local government reform might help contain
                        the impact of rising costs in the health sector on local public expenditure,
                        but its benefits will take time to materialise.</p>

                        accounted for 50% of total revenues of sub­central governments before the
                        2007 institutional reform and only 33% after the reform as tax revenues of
                        regions have been replaced by grants (<xref

                        represent around 60% of municipalities’ revenues, the remaining part
                        primarily coming from grants. Financing through grants weakens the link
                        between the costs of primarily services and taxes, creating an incentive at
                        the local level to demand more services, even if the marginal benefit does
                        not exceed the marginal cost and therefore leads to higher outlays and
                        deficits (Hallerberg and Von Hagen, 1999; Careaga and Weingast, 2000;
                        Blöchliger and Petzold, 2009). Grant systems may also cause sub­central
                        governments to be less vigilant with their finances. Aware that the central
                        government is helping them out, they increase their deficit, expecting to
                        obtain higher grants in the next period. They then face a soft budget
                        constraint and the growth of transfers from the central government becomes
                        endogenous (Tanzi, 1995; Ter­Minassian, 1999). Indeed, grants were raised to
                        finance overruns of spending. Nevertheless, since 1988, 29 municipalities
                        have faced financial problems and have been subjected to special
                        arrangements (Mau, 2011). These problems resulted from budget errors,
                        non­compliance with borrowing regulations and overestimation of the tax
                        base.</p>

                        the central government and the local government association representing
                        municipalities (called KL). This was supposed to create agreement between

                        cuts in general grants (Lotz, 2010). As those sanctions were aggressive,
                        they were thought to have ruined the negotiation system and were then

                        of control of local public expenditures. As taxes were frozen,
                        municipalities have managed to find other sources of revenue, such as their
                        own resources (land for instance) and higher grants. The tax freeze has put

                        became even more crucial to receive high grants since tax increases were

                        good demographic and economic conditions could have cut their tax rates, but

                        them in areas where they are largely determined by regulations and standards
                        set at the central level (<xref

                        municipalities have limited power over their budgets, they may tend to
                        function as agencies funded and regulated by the state government rather
                        than as independent policymakers, which might explain why they face
                        difficulties in setting spending priorities or enforcing spending cuts.
                        Furthermore, when local self­governance is weak, the central government is
                        implicitly responsible for the quality of services provided at the local
                        level, giving it a reason to intervene in the case of fiscal problems, which
                        in turn generates expectations at the local level that fiscal problems will
                        be solved by the central government. A pilot OECD survey has measured the
                            <shortcitation>spending power</shortcitation> of local government for a
                        group of countries, including Denmark, in four policy areas – child care,
                        elderly care, education and public transports (Bach <emphasis emph="italic"
                            >et al.</emphasis>, 2009). The indicator measures the extent to which
                        services provided by sub­central governments are governed by rules and
                        regulations set centrally. It shows that in the four areas under
                        consideration, local authorities’ spending powers are limited in

                        contained municipalities’ expenditures. However, past experience shows that

                        rules and sanctions. A major difficulty will be enforcing the newly
                        introduced measures. The new fiscal framework is, in itself, more binding
                        and less easy to circumvent, but its success will also depend on the
                        political will to enforce it.</p>

                        need to reinforce mechanisms that ensure that individual municipalities feel
                        constrained by rules covering all municipalities. KL is already in charge of
                        setting out a distribution of expenditure ceilings for municipalities
                        consistent with the aggregate ceiling. However, as there is no legal status
                        for these individual ceilings, municipalities can budget expenditures
                        exceeding the ceiling. In this case, the current rules do not allow the
                        government to impose individual sanctions but collective sanctions will be
                        applied. The former government proposed to allow the government to impose
                        individual sanctions in cases where budgeted expenditures are not consistent
                        with the aggregate ceiling. It is important to implement this change.
                        Furthermore, negotiations on the distribution of expenditure ceilings and
                        grants should take place once the overall ceiling and budget for grants have
                        been fixed. In Norway for instance, there is a two­stage budget procedure,
                        whereby the overall budget for grants is determined before<emphasis

                        sub­central governments. The Economic Council has proposed to introduce a
                        system of tradable municipal rights, limiting overall municipalities’
                        expenditures to the number of <shortcitation>rights</shortcitation> (Danish
                        Economic Council, 2010b). Under this system, each municipality would be
                        allocated an individual expenditure right and would have to buy (sell)
                        expenditure rights to increase spending above (below) its allocated rights.
                        The system – analogous to what exists in Austria – would make municipalities
                        internalise the cost of raising public expenditures but may be complicated
                        to implement.</p>

                        spending ceilings should help prevent slippages. If they were to fail to
                        contain local public expenditures, consideration should be given to better
                        align municipalities’ spending and revenue autonomy to prevent spending and
                        taxes from rising beyond voters’ choices. A well­functioning local
                        democracy, where the impact of taxes on the local population is transparent
                        and with some tax competition between municipalities, would prevent spending
                        and taxes from increasing beyond voters’ choices (Joumard and Kongsrud,
                        2003). Voters would vote for lower taxes when the cost of new services
                        exceeds their benefits. Sweden, for instance, which is also a relatively
                        decentralised country (albeit less so than Denmark), has managed to create a
                        local democracy that functions well, and has helped to contain local

                                        central government not to bail out sub­central governments,
                                        as is the case in Sweden. However, due to the right to levy
                                        taxes, the Swedish Constitution does not allow local
                                        governments to declare bankruptcy. A local government cannot
                                        decide to cease to exist and only Parliament can decide to
                                        merge local governments. In this case, the responsibility
                                        for assets and liabilities is transferred to another local
                                        government. In practice, market pressures may nonetheless
                                        have contributed to the healthy fiscal position of Swedish
                                        local governments, and thus to their high
                                        creditworthiness.</p>

                                the Swedish framework has led to good outcomes, but it is criticised
                                for contributing to a pro­cyclical policy at the local level. Since
                                the municipalities and county councils are required to plan for
                                balanced budgets each year and transfers are strictly limited, there
                                is a risk that they tend to reduce expenditure when tax revenues
                                fall. This happened during the recent crisis. The government has
                                acknowledged this problem and recently appointed a committee to
                                propose solutions. In particular, the committee will look into the

                        expenditure from rising permanently when tax revenues increase temporarily,
                        because of a cyclical upswing for instance. However, these changes may take

                                much in periods of economic booms. For instance, in the US state of
                                Colorado, state government revenues are not allowed to grow faster
                                than the sum of the growth rates of the regional consumer price
                                index and state population (OECD, 2005). Revenues collected in
                                excess of these limits must be returned to the taxpayers in the
                                following fiscal year by any reasonable means, unless voters approve
                                of the government keeping or spending these revenues. However, in

                                is no clear rationale why government spending per capita should
                                remain constant in real terms, and this formula may be inappropriate
                                to tackle demographic changes. For a short period of time, however,

                        voluntary early retirement programmes (VERP), which was adopted by the

                        (from 2019 to 2014) the rise in the retirement age. Estimates by the Danish
                        Economic Council show that these reforms would substantially strengthen
                        fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, by increasing the retirement age more
                        rapidly than planned in the 2006 Welfare Agreement, this reform implies a
                        more equal treatment between present and future generations (Danish Economic
                        Council, 2011). Hence, the decision by the new government to implement this

                                    have been made over the years to the VERP in order to limit the

                                    postpone entrance into the VERP by two years (typically to the
                                    62th year), by lowering the pension during the first two years.

                                    was lowered from 67 to 65, which led to a decrease in the share

                                    The 2006 Welfare Agreement took a step further by raising the
                                    VERP retirement age by two years from 60 to 62, gradually
                                    from 2019 to 2022. The agreement also raised the age of the
                                    old­age pension scheme by two years from 65 to 67, gradually
                                    from 2024 to 2027 so that all generations can have five years on
                                    the VERP. Furthermore, the Welfare Agreement established a
                                    mechanism under which the retirement age is indexed on life
                                    expectancy at 60, starting in 2025. Changes will have to be
                                    announced 10 years in advance and a new decision will be made
                                    every five years.</p>

                        of disability benefits with work capacity back to the job market is a
                        challenge. The government should closely monitor VERP reform and its impact
                        on the number of recipients. It should also persevere with efforts to
                        improve the efficiency of programmes to help the disabled with work capacity
                        to find a job. The special disabled employment programme (<emphasis
                            emph="italic">Fleksjob</emphasis>) has led to an increase in the overall
                        number of recipients of these programmes and therefore should be
                        reconsidered, in particular by making it more targeted on individuals in
                        need and less generous as the income can be higher than the previous wage. A
                        plan to reform the special disabled employment programme following these
                        lines was proposed in April 2011 but reforms have been postponed since then
                        although the new government has announced a reform of the <emphasis
                            emph="italic">Fleksjob</emphasis> scheme (Danish Government, 2011).
                        There is also a case for better integrating disability benefits with other
                        policies to make work pay and helping the sick and disabled with sufficient
                        ability to work to find ordinary employment (OECD, 2010b). The current
                        responsibility structure, with municipalities being key players but not
                        having the necessary powers could be improved. This reflects a larger issue
                        of shared responsibilities between the central government and municipalities
                        concerning labour market and social policies. While municipalities are in

                        level have impeded the efficiency of those job centres. For instance, job

                        including by ensuring early involvement of municipal doctors and regular
                        control of general practitioners’ decisions (OECD, 2010b).</p>

                        performance of the education system is mixed. On the one hand, education
                        attainment is high in Denmark and youth unemployment has not been a major
                        problem (OECD, 2010c). On the other hand, PISA results are slightly above
                        average for Danish students in general, and rather poor for immigrants.
                        Furthermore, the share of youth with no upper secondary education is at the
                        OECD average (<xref refid="IDee020883-5dd3-4e83-b3e3-52cfdfcde909"

                        OECD, 2009). Formal analysis of the efficiency of public spending in primary
                        and secondary education suggests that maintaining the same level of
                        expenditure and moving towards best practice would lift performance
                        substantially, or that moving towards best practice would help to achieve
                        the same performance at a much lower cost (Sutherland <emphasis

                        education system would also help boost productivity growth (OECD, 2009;
                        Danish Economic Council, 2010b). Better human capital lifts productivity in
                        existing jobs and facilitates restructuring towards higher­value­added
                        activities, entrepreneurship and R&amp;D.</p>

                        degree of school autonomy in Denmark and municipalities are responsible for
                        the quality of compulsory education for public schools (and parent­elected
                        boards for private schools), the evaluation and assessment framework plays a
                        key role for central and local authorities to promote and monitor quality
                        and focus on improvement. Evaluation gives incentives to both students and
                        teachers to perform better, but to be more effective it should come with
                        higher pay flexibility for teachers and school managers. Similar
                        recommendations were made in the recent OECD <emphasis emph="italic">Review
                            of Evaluation and Assessment in Danish Education </emphasis>that calls
                        for stepping up the implementation of newly introduced measures to monitor
                        and evaluate quality in compulsory education (Shewbridge <emphasis
                            emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011). The implementation of these
                        measures varies among schools and municipalities and there is a need to
                        develop evaluation and assessment at all levels of compulsory education.</p>

                        relatively high rate of drop­outs. The education system leaves a number of
                        youth behind and fails to target special individual problems. Recent
                        findings suggest that the education system, like labour market policies,
                        needs to be individualised to yield good outcomes. This is a dimension that
                        Denmark has successfully introduced in its ALMPs but to a lesser extent in
                        education, as opposed to Finland for instance (<xref

                        compulsory tests of students would help identify the weakest students
                        earlier on. Furthermore, for schools to better adapt to the needs of all
                        their students, both native and immigrant, there is a need to
                        professionalise school leadership through better training and to improve the
                        pedagogical skills and quality of teachers (Nusche <emphasis emph="italic"
                            >et al.</emphasis>, 2010). Specific targeted initiatives to close the
                        performance gap between Danish and immigrant students should be developed.
                        For instance, the previous OECD <emphasis emph="italic">Economic
                            Survey</emphasis> recommended targeting the optional year following the
                        nine years of compulsory education (the <shortcitation>10th
                            form</shortcitation>) on the weakest students and to review vocational
                        education. Reducing the size of classes in high schools, which is already
                        relatively low compared to other OECD countries, as proposed by the Budget

                                long been a focus on the need for social policies to be
                                    <shortcitation>active</shortcitation> rather than
                                    <shortcitation>passive</shortcitation>. Recent analysis has
                                shown that social policies have to shift away from insurance and
                                move towards <shortcitation>skill­based risk
                                    mitigation</shortcitation> and individualised actions
                                    (Sabel <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). This
                                concerns in particular education and ALMPs.</p>

                                several reasons for having individualised social services. First,
                                new findings on learning show that individuals learn differently and
                                learning problems need not be permanent, thus calling for an
                                individualised pedagogical approach. Another reason is the awareness
                                that risks faced by individuals can be structural (such as for
                                instance the fall in demand for low­skilled workers) and require
                                individuals to have the capacity to overcome these types of
                                disruptions. A third reason is the increasing heterogeneity of
                                populations.</p>

                                the individualisation of service provision, Denmark is an
                                interesting case with its ALMP system being highly individualised
                                and successful, while its education system is not. The Finnish
                                education system, which gives very good results (measured by PISA)
                                is much more customised to individual needs than the Danish system.
                                In particular, the Finnish system uses testing of pupils extensively
                                and at an early stage. These tests are not being used for sanctions,
                                but to detect learning problems. Another feature of the Finnish
                                system is the large use of special education, with almost one third
                                of pupils receiving special short­term instruction, mainly in
                                standard classrooms.</p>

                        education, the main problems are that: <emphasis emph="italic"

                        reducing the supply of high­skilled labour (OECD, 2009); and <emphasis

                        relatively low business needs and weak productivity potential (Growth Forum,
                        2011). Gradually moving to a system that combines grants and loans in a way
                        that encourages on­time completion – the duration of grants could be
                        shortened – could help. Going even further, a system of tuition fees with
                        income­contingent loans should be considered. Tuition fees would give
                        universities more resources and/or free up public resources to be applied to
                        other priorities in education or elsewhere. Furthermore, by creating a price
                        signal, tuition fees would encourage students to take earnings prospects
                        after graduation more into account when making study choices. However, care
                        should be taken not to reduce overall incentives to take up education.</p>

                        has decreased significantly, the impact of past behaviour may contribute to
                        current relatively low life expectancy. Alcohol consumption is also

                        of governments. This is mainly because several levels of government are
                        involved in key health care decisions, with regions being broadly in charge
                        of hospitals and municipalities of out­patient care. However, the allocation
                        of responsibilities is more complex than this broad picture suggests. For
                        instance, regions negotiate tariffs and wages of practitioners and fix their
                        number. Furthermore, while regions are in charge of hospitals, the Ministry
                        of Health sets the payment methods for hospitals and the number of hospitals
                        per region. Regions’ expenditures are mainly financed by a state block grant
                        that amounts for 75% of their revenues. The involvement of several levels of
                        government can lead to waste through duplication, lax control over spending
                        when responsibilities overlap and insufficient exploitation of economies of
                        scale (Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003). Furthermore, this allocation of
                        responsibilities requires having an incentive system that ensures that each
                        level of government does not try to transfer costs to the other level. For
                        instance, under the current system, as regions cannot fully control costs,
                        they have an incentive to ask for higher grants. Municipalities have limited
                        incentives to develop preventive measures as they only partly bear hospital
                        costs. Indeed, while they contribute 20% to the financing of hospitals, only
                        half of this contribution depends on their use of regional services. The
                        allocation of responsibilities and resources across different levels of
                        government could thus be rationalised. Furthermore, funding should be
                        refined further to give incentives to achieve good performance. In
                        particular, remuneration of doctors and out­of­pocket payments are very low
                        in Denmark. Another option would be to change the assignment of
                        responsibilities, with either the regions or the central level being fully
                        in charge of health issues. More detailed recommendations on health were

                    further, by raising the tax threshold for the top personal income tax rate or
                    cutting the marginal tax rate. The new government has announced a fully­financed

                    tax revenues in 2006 (OECD, 2010d), as a result of the Danish government’s

                    after pioneering strict regulations on the use of transfat (commonly used in
                    industrially produced food) in 2004. The fat tax is meant to help address
                    overweight and obesity problems, and thereby, to reduce the occurrence of
                    cardiovascular diseases. While the share of the obese in the population is still
                    relatively low from an international perspective, it has been on the rise over
                    the past 15 years (Rockwool Foundation Research Unit, 2011). The effect of the
                    fat tax on health status is unclear, however, as health depends on the overall
                    diet, not only on fat intake, and on the overall nutrients contained in food.
                    The proposal made in the Budget Bill for 2012 to raise taxes on other unhealthy
                    products could help to improve the overall diet and thereby enhance the effect
                    of the fat tax. The latter will have distributional impacts: <emphasis

                    be particularly affected as food accounts for a larger share of their spending,
                    especially in so far as the demand for these products is inelastic; <emphasis
                        emph="italic">ii)</emphasis> in the longer term, as these households are
                    also those who are the most exposed to obesity problems, they may benefit from
                    the tax, provided that they do not switch to products with higher detrimental
                    effects on health. The effect of the tax on prices and consumption patterns will
                    be central in this respect. Early observations suggest that the prices of some

                    strategy focuses on moving the energy system away from fossil fuels and
                    investing in green technologies, while limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
                    On the whole, current policies should allow Denmark to reach near­term climate
                    change targets, but may not be sufficient to achieve its most ambitious targets.
                    The challenge is to achieve objectives in a cost­effective manner and to ensure
                    that these ambitions contribute as much as possible to global GHG emissions
                    mitigation and to stronger and greener growth in Denmark. Better exploiting
                    interactions with EU and international policies, finding the appropriate way to
                    support green technologies and reducing GHG emissions in sectors not covered by
                    the EU emission trading scheme are key issues which need to be addressed to meet
                    this challenge.</p>

            <p id="ID1ea6ad2d-d1d1-4558-9b17-d62395296c56" numbering="n">Green growth ranks high on
                Denmark’s policy agenda. The country has taken measures and developed plans to
                reduce the use of fossil fuels and limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as
                other forms of pollution, while investing in green technologies as a potential new
                source of growth. The target of eliminating fossil fuels without the use of nuclear
                energy by 2050 stands out. In many respects, this strategy is visionary. However, it
                also illustrates the difficulties to achieve various green growth objectives when
                uncertainties and irreversibilities surround technological choices even as
                international policies and actions are evolving.</p>
            <p id="ID2241b050-e5b7-4ff3-9612-19ba4d1cd38a" numbering="n">As in many other countries,
                energy policy in Denmark was dominated historically by concerns about the security
                of energy supply rather than climate change. After the first oil crisis in 1973,
                energy policy aimed at making the energy system less dependent on imported oil.
                Since the mid­1980s, most energy policies focussed on reducing the dependence on
                foreign suppliers and on improving supply security by increasing energy efficiency.
                Governments have also introduced actions and plans to shift away from energy sources
                that are likely to become scarce, and to move towards renewables.</p>
            <p id="IDed76d663-cafc-4403-b4c3-3638ba5df119" numbering="n">These various policies have
                led to considerable energy efficiency gains and a more diversified energy supply
                based, in addition to oil, on coal, natural gas and renewables. The utilisation of
                oil and gas resources from the North Sea and, more recently, the expansion of wind
                power have turned the country into a net energy exporter. These policies have also
                helped lower GHG emissions. Denmark took measures to reduce CO<specchar
                    font="default" position="sub">2</specchar> emissions during the 1990s, ratified
                the Kyoto Protocol and participates in EU climate policies. More recently, the new
                government has announced a target to reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2020 from the
                1990 base, which is, with Norway, the largest reduction pledged by a developed
                country.</p>
            <p id="ID2d4dcc57-70f6-4c6e-af61-afa0bdceefe5" numbering="n">Denmark thus pursues a mix
                of energy and climate change policies and stands out by the ambition of its
                objectives. The challenge is to achieve these objectives in a cost­effective manner
                and to ensure that these ambitions contribute as much as possible to global GHG
                emissions mitigation and to stronger and greener growth in Denmark.</p>

                Danish energy and climate policies and discusses how they could be improved to
                ensure that objectives are met at least cost. It first depicts the evolution of GHG
                emissions and the energy mix since 1990. It then puts energy and climate policies
                and targets into perspective and sets out the main challenges. The final section
                assesses how policies could be shaped to enhance the efficiency of these targets and
                minimise their costs.</p>

                    Nevertheless, several countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden) reduced their
                    emissions per capita more than Denmark. This mostly reflects limited gains in
                    energy efficiency, stemming from the fact that Denmark already used energy
                    relatively efficiently in 1990 (<xref

                    emission intensity of energy in Denmark has dropped, it remains relatively high,
                    reflecting the evolution of the energy mix. Since the early 1990s, the share of
                    coal and oil in total energy consumption has tended to decline, and that of
                    natural gas and renewables to rise but since 2000, the fall in the use of coal

                    energy mix, which relies mostly on fossil fuels (80% of total primary energy

                        considered policies to reduce GHG emissions as part of a set of broader
                        objectives and has been a pioneer in climate change mitigation policies.
                        In 1992, Denmark was one of the first countries, just after Sweden, to
                        introduce carbon taxation, with a carbon tax on some energy uses by
                        households and space heating in industry, which has since been increased and
                        extended to other industrial processes (OECD, 2007a). The tax rate differed
                        across users and sectors, with households paying most (<xref

                        rates applied to energy­intensive industries on the ground of
                        competitiveness concerns. In addition, these industries benefited from tax
                        rebates in the context of voluntary agreements with the authorities for
                        implementing energy­saving measures. The revenues of the carbon tax were
                        earmarked to subsidise environmental innovation. CO<specchar font="default"

                        for the development of renewable energy will also be challenging. In the
                        Danish Energy Agency scenario, the share of renewables in total energy
                        consumption would reach 28%, just below the 30% target to which Denmark has
                        committed itself at the EU level. The corresponding share for the transport
                        sector would be only 6%, well below the 10% EU target. In 2009, around 19%
                        of domestic electricity came from wind power. Under the Danish Energy Agency
                        scenario, the share of electricity from wind would rise slightly above 30%
                        by 2020, hence also well below the new target to have 50% of electricity
                        coming from wind by 2020. This scenario assumes an expansion of offshore
                        wind turbines as already contracted and the replacement of onshore wind
                        turbines by more efficient ones. The expansion of onshore wind turbines is
                        uncertain as capacity constraints are already almost fully exploited. Hence,
                        it is very likely that the capacity will have to be mainly extended offshore
                        to meet the 50% target, which is likely to remain more costly than onshore
                        technologies for quite some time (<xref

                        One of the major challenges will be to bring down emissions in the non­ETS
                        sectors, more than 70% of which are accounted for by emissions from
                        agriculture and transport. Marginal abatement costs are expected to be high

                                        associated with the wind technology as the turbine cost
                                        typically represent about 75% of the total cost, with

                        has confirmed the long­term vision of relieving Denmark completely of its
                        dependence on fossil fuels, indicating how this target will be achieved in
                            <emphasis emph="italic">Our Future Energy</emphasis> (Danish Government,
                        2011a). This document follows up on the <emphasis emph="italic">Energy
                            Strategy 2050 </emphasis>developed by the previous government (Danish
                        Government, 2011b), which built on the analysis of the Commission on Climate
                        Change Policy discussing out how to acheive independence from fossil fuels.
                        The challenge is a formidable one, as 80% of primary energy consumption now
                        comes from fossil fuels. The definition of independence used by the
                        Commission is that <shortcitation>no fossil energy is used/consumed in
                            Denmark, and the average annual domestic production of electricity based
                            on renewables must at least equal Danish consumption</shortcitation>
                        (Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy, 2010). Under this definition,
                        Denmark can continue to trade electricity with countries where it is based
                        on fossil fuels provided this is offset by exports of renewable energy, but
                        cannot continue to consume oil in the transport sector and to compensate for
                        this by exporting electricity based on renewables. The definition of
                        independence used in <emphasis emph="italic">Our Future Energy</emphasis> is
                        that the energy and transport network should rely solely on renewables. This
                        definition is more ambitious than the one used by the Commission on Climate
                        Change Policy.</p>

                        offered 40 specific recommendations, involving a massive conversion to
                        electricity from offshore wind turbines, complemented by biomass as a backup
                        for wind turbines as well as for part of the transport sector that can
                        hardly rely on electricity. Nuclear power was rejected by the Danish
                        Parliament in 1985 and is not considered as a cost­effective option for this
                        transition. In terms of market­based instruments, the Commission recommended
                        to have an energy tax (expressed in DKK per energy unit) applied uniformly
                        to all fossil fuel uses and gradually increasing over time. It also
                        recommended equalising the domestic carbon tax to the carbon price on the EU
                        ETS market so as to approximate a cost­effective allocation of emission

                        more than double over that period. This stems from a number of factors

                        international prices adjust, given the fact that oil markets are fairly
                        integrated and governments have built strategic stocks. However, natural gas
                        shortages may last longer due to market segmentation and the relative
                        inflexibility of gas­pipeline infrastructure. The coal market is also
                        fragmented. Price instability remains a concern over the longer term insofar
                        as the supply of fossil fuels becomes less and less elastic and concentrated
                        into the hands of a small number of producing countries, hence raising the
                        risk of large unexpected price shifts as a result, in particular, of
                        political instability. While Denmark is among the countries that use energy
                        most efficiently, energy security is an important issue as the share of oil
                        and natural gas in total Danish energy consumption is large (<xref

                        those with higher abatement costs can buy permits. In addition to the EU ETS
                        carbon price, there are several other national policies in ETS sectors that
                        are unlikely to bring short­term global environmental benefits, due to
                        spillover effects across EU countries. Permits not bought by Danish ETS

                        is essential to foster green innovation. This is because there are several

                        technologies, as innovations may emerge from a wide range of fields.
                        Finally, the overall financing framework should be credible and stable to
                        foster investment in new technologies.</p>

                        funds for environmental non­energy related research has gradually been
                        reduced since the mid­1990s. Empirical analysis based on 2000­07 Danish
                        firm­level data concluded that there was no economic justification for
                        targeting government R&amp;D expenditures on energy research performed in
                        private firms as opposed to other environmentally­related research (Danish
                        Economic Council, 2011). Therefore, R&amp;D policies should leave some
                        flexibility as regards the choice of specific technology, be harmonised
                        across technologies and re­assessed in light of the precise market failure
                        they try to address.</p>
                    <p id="IDeb4302a4-a3c4-48f7-a7db-6d2dd57f0635" numbering="n">A feed­in tariff
                        system is also in place, and it is the main policy to support electricity
                        from renewables, with tariffs being larger for wind than for other renewable
                        energy technologies. This system provides large subsidies to these
                        technologies as offshore wind technologies remain very expensive compared to
                        other options (IEA, 2010). Feed­in tariffs, as opposed to electricity
                        certificates, allow adjusting the size of the subsidy to the technology,
                        which can be justified by differences in cost structures and maturity of
                        technologies. For this reason, feed­in tariffs are found to encourage
                        innovations that are further from the market than electricity certificates
                            (Johnstone <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). However,
                        experience has shown that once granted, support in the form of subsidies can
                        be very difficult to withdraw even when the initial justification no longer
                        applies and rents tend to be captured by specific industries
                            (de Serres <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011). The
                        lobbying power of these industries can be large when the national strategy
                        is built on them. To limit this risk and to ensure that least cost options
                        are developed, differences in subsidy between technologies should be
                        justified by differences in cost structures and maturity of technologies. In
                        the absence of such justification, subsidies should be made more uniform
                        across technologies. This is the case in Estonia, for instance, while in
                        most other countries, the level of support in feed­in tariffs depends on the
                        technology. The new government has proposed a reduction in the subsidies to
                        future land­based windmills as their cost is expected to fall further, but
                        subsidies to off­shore windmills will be increased. It also plans to review
                        the energy tax and subsidy systems to raise incentives to switch from fossil
                        fuels to electricity in non­EU­ETS sectors. The race between EU countries in
                        terms of support to technologies through their feed­in tariffs illustrates
                        the need for an EU policy to support renewables. A common strategy to
                        support renewables with a view to minimise costs and risks and to limit the
                        race between EU countries in terms of support to these technologies would
                        help achieve the renewable target in a cost­effective manner (OECD, 2009c).
                        However, support would have to be restricted to technologies that require it
                        in addition to that provided by the EU ETS carbon price.</p>

                        sector is an area where more emission cuts are likely to be achievable at a
                        moderate cost (Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy, 2010). Buildings
                        account for 40% of energy consumption in Denmark. Information problems in
                        the residential sector lead to situations where poorly informed households
                        and firms may act inefficiently even in the face of market incentives. For
                        instance, landlords have better information than tenants but have little
                        incentive to install the most energy­efficient equipment as they do not pay
                        the energy bill (OECD, 2009a; IEA, 2007b). Well designed regulations can
                        address these problems. Denmark has introduced a series of regulations to
                        increase energy savings in buildings. They include stringent building codes
                        for new buildings and regulations on energy labeling of buildings and on
                        inspection of heating installations. There is also some support to the
                        installation of heat pumps in areas situated outside the collective supply
                        grid.</p>

                        there is no need for further requirements beyond the already stringent
                        existing ones. The main issues would be to implement these regulations and
                        to monitor compliance. As there are greater opportunities to cut energy
                        consumption in existing buildings and to exploit them at lower cost, greater
                        incentives should be given to implement energy improvements in connection
                        with renovation and replacement carried out for other reasons. Energy taxes
                        contribute to these incentives as fossil fuels are still largely used for
                        heating.</p>

                        fossil fuels and there are no alternatives to fossil fuels that are
                        competitive in terms of technology and price. Hence reducing GHG emissions

                        However, the Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy has concluded, based
                        on background studies to its report, that even a doubling in public
                        passenger transport (trains and buses) will reduce car numbers by only
                        around 15%, which will be more than offset by the expected growth in car
                        numbers over the next ten years. Another option to limit the use of cars is
                        road pricing, which is not used in Denmark apart from some bridges. However,

                                the most important polluters when emissions per capita are
                                considered (Hoornweg <emphasis emph="italic"
                                >et al.</emphasis>, 2011). Copenhagen stands out as an example in
                                this respect: in 2005, CO<specchar font="default" position="sub"
                                    >2</specchar> emissions per capita in the municipality of

                                reflects cities’ potential to reduce GHG emissions per capita. For
                                instance, higher population density makes public transport more
                                attractive, limiting the use of cars, and makes it easier and less
                                costly to develop district heating systems (OECD, 2011c). In
                                contrast, some GHG emissions from agriculture are difficult to
                                reduce, explaining relatively large emissions per capita in rural
                                areas. Suburbanisation can also contribute strongly to GHG
                                emissions.</p>

                                Copenhagen’s strategy rests on plans and policies very similar to

                        fuels provide some incentives to reduce the use of cars. In Denmark as in
                        many other countries, diesel is taxed less than petrol (<xref
                            refid="IDd9922dd3-036c-44e1-9c8f-1a5c758753dc" capital="no"
                            object="figure" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). As the carbon
                        content is higher for diesel than petrol, the implicit carbon price on
                        emissions from diesel is significantly below the one on petrol. Hence, there
                        is room to raise taxes on diesel, although this may lead to more
                        cross­border trade. In the transport sector, there exists, on top of the
                        carbon tax and energy taxes, some taxes on motor vehicles to be paid
                        regularly and a one­off motor vehicle tax for new cars. These taxes depend
                        on the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, but on the whole, they are high in
                        Denmark, thus providing incentives to reduce the use of cars
                        (Braathen, 2011). The motor vehicle registration tax is particularly stiff,
                        with a basic rate of 105% on the value of the car below EUR 10 000 and 180%
                        above this threshold, except for electric cars, which are exempted. This tax
                        provides a one­off incentive to purchase a less emitting car but no
                        incentive for further abatement after the purchase (OECD, 2010a).
                        Furthermore, the high level of the tax may discourage purchases, implying
                        that older and less efficient cars are used. As emissions vary with motor
                        vehicle use, it would be more cost­effective to tax motor vehicles less and
                        fuels more as long as this adjustment does not lead to a large increase in
                        border trade.</p>

                        new government is planning to introduce a congestion tax, as in London and
                        Stockholm for instance, to reduce congestion and local air pollution. The
                        effect of this tax on GHG and local air pollutant emissions will depend on
                        the design of the scheme. A toll ring, as currently under discussion for
                        Copenhagen, may have only limited impact as it would lead to some additional
                        traffic to circumvent the payment zone. A system such as the one envisaged
                        at some point in the Netherlands – which was to be GPS­based, to include
                        both a per­kilometre price and a peak surcharge and to cover all roads –
                        would likely cut pollutant emissions more (OECD, 2010b). Furthermore,
                        experience from other countries shows that for this tax to bring some net
                        benefits, road congestion needs to be severe and congestion in public
                        transportation should be low (OECD, 2011a). While road congestion may be
                        lower in Copenhagen than in several other large cities, it has increased
                        substantially in recent years.</p>

                                land. In the past, too much of the low­lying land was converted into
                                farm land subject to intensive cultivation. Excessive use of

                                policies have been implemented to reduce these discharges but also

                                for the Aquatic Environment II was launched in 1998 with the aim of
                                reducing nitrogen leaching by a further 37 000 tonnes by 2003,
                                bringing the total reduction relative to the mid­1980s to close 50%.

                        favours relatively energy­efficient activities that emit a lot of methane

                        There are also a number of technologies in the livestock sector for reducing
                        methane and nitrous oxide emissions from management and storage of manure.

                        Model simulations show that the cost of achieving the 20% emission cut in
                        non­EU­ETS sectors would be large if all these cuts were to be achieved
                        domestically (Danish Economic Council, 2011). According to these estimates,
                        assuming that all these cuts are achieved through a uniform carbon price,
                        the price would have to be set at a very high level (of EUR 280 per tonne of

                        assumptions. Nevertheless, they show that, from a cost­effectiveness
                        perspective, most actions in non­ETS sectors should probably take place at a
                        later stage of the transition when all cheaper options in the ETS sectors
                        are exhausted, and that Denmark should achieve part of its target by

                        technological developments at the international level. It will thus be
                        important to reassess these targets in this light, notably in the transport

                        mature technologies but also more mature ones. One challenge with the wind
                        technology is to cope with fluctuations in electricity production and
                        demand. This is reflected by the introduction of negative prices in 2009 on
                        the Nordic electricity market to allow producers to pay to deliver power in
                        the market in case of high wind rather than to have to support the imbalance
                        costs (Nordic Energy Regulators, 2011). This option has been used by Danish
                        producers even as their production is highly subsidised. Another issue is to
                        address harmful effects in terms of low­frequency noise, which has caused
