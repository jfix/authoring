		<title>ACCOUNTABILITY SHIFTS IN EDUCATION</title>
		<section>
			<title>Building schools’ capacity</title>
			<para>The work of school leaders is crucial to building school capacity for multiple accountability because accountability processes are nested in beliefs, experiences, and practices in schools. It requires school leaders who are willing and able to empower staff, and in turn, to involve and share responsibility with parents and other interested members of the local community. It also requires school leaders who are willing to be held accountable by them (Leithwood, 2001).</para>
			<para>Apart from leadership, the capacity to handle data is a key element of school capacity building with respect to accountability (Ozga, 2009; Fullan, 2000). Masses of data are available through assessment and monitoring systems, indicators of effectiveness, targets, inspection, and review programs. Methods for accessing information and, consequently, analysing and interpreting it, are not self-evident in schools. As early as the 1970s, many of the relevant data were not available for schools or at least not in a form which could be easily used (Levin, 1974). Apart from the lack of availability and feasibility of data, until recently there was often a gap between the interests expressed in data and the actual use of data. Schools need the capability to transform data into knowledge appropriate for multiple accountability purposes. This requires proper school self-evaluation: obtaining real insights into the quality and processes of schools that are relevant to the practice of accountability on multiple fronts.</para>
			<para>Coping with data requires that educators themselves become experts in interpreting data and transforming it into knowledge. Earl and Katz (2002; 2006, cited in Geijsel et al., 2010, p.62), point to three capacities that school leaders need in order to work in a data-rich world: </para>
			<itemized-list>
				<list-item>
					<para>Achieve the inflation target and, as planned, reduce it over time. This would be achieved by relying on interest rate, liquidity management and macro‑prudential measures<emphasis style="italic">.</emphasis></para>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<para>Step up efforts to pass a micro‑finance law, and expand the sectoral coverage of the regulatory framework.</para>

				<emphasis style="bold">Policies to finance key development programmes</emphasis>
			</para>
			<itemized-list>
				<list-item>
					<para>Significantly diminish fossil‑fuel and electricity subsidies, and implement enhanced compensatory cash‑transfer programmes to prevent a rise in poverty. Communicate widely on the efficiency and distributional benefits of reform. As an interim measure, re‑establish a rule linking fuel prices to developments in international oil markets, to remain valid until subsidies are markedly reduced.</para>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<para>Move the resource‑sector tax regime closer to a system of taxing rents. Review export taxes, considering their implications for the whole economy, including international trade. Phase out exemptions from VAT. Revisit corporate tax holidays granted to firms in “pioneer industries”.</para>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<para>Enhance efforts to bring the self‑employed into the tax net, including by reducing temporarily penalties for previous non‑compliance for first‑time taxpayers only. Increase resources devoted to auditing high‑risk and affluent taxpayers, and make more use of third‑party information to assess tax liabilities.</para>
