		<para>Fyffes was a company involved in the banana trade. It found that an employee who negotiated a service agreement with a shipping contractor took bribes amounting to more than USD 1.4 million between 1992 and 1996. Fyffes sought to recover damages from the employee, the shipping company, and its agents. </para>
		<para>All defendants were found jointly liable for the value of the bribes. The court ruled that “there can be no dispute that [the bribes] were taken into account by <emphasis style="italic">the contractor </emphasis> in agreeing the amount of the freight for each year, which would have been correspondingly less for Fyffes if they had only had to pay the net sum which <emphasis style="italic">the contractor </emphasis> were prepared to accept.” The shipping company and its agents were liable to pay additional compensation for the loss that Fyffes suffered from entering into the contract under unfavourable terms. </para>
		<para>To reach this conclusion, the judge rejected an account (a disgorgement) of all profits made by the contractor because it was “highly probable that Fyffes would have entered into a service agreement with the contractor if the employee had not been dishonest.” As a result, “ordinary” profit from the contract was not caused by bribery, but by “the provision of services for which there would have been a contract in any event.” </para>
