		<metadata-item property="kim:description" value="The IEA Energy Technology Perspectives Study (ETP) 2008 demonstrates that CCS will need to contribute nearly one-fifth of the necessary emissions reductions to reduce global GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 at a reasonable cost. In the following, starting from an outline of the prospects of CCS based on a scenario analysis with the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) model, an overview of the technology options, their costs and research and development (R&amp;D) challenges for captvalueURIng CO2 in power generation and subsequently transporting and storing is given. The EGC Expert Group is invited to discuss the content of the document in the context of Projected Costs of Generating Electricity and to provide comments to the Secretariat."/>

			<title>Calculating the damages</title>
			<para>Under clause 10 of the service agreement Fyffes were obliged to pay Seatrade for any bunker fuel consumed in additional mileage from a substitution of ports on any voyage. There was no converse provision entitling Fyffes to a rebate for the reduction in bunker fuel consumed if steaming was saved. The expert for the plaintiff considered it very unusual for such a provision not to work both ways and that an honest and prudent charterer would not have agreed to the clause as drafted. The defence effectively conceded the point. Fyffes are entitled under this head to USD 471 940 as claimed. </para>
