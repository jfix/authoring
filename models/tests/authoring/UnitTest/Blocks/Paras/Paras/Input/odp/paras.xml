		<para> Company groups are well established in all reviewed economies and, with the exception of <emphasis style="bold">India </emphasis> in some areas and <emphasis style="bold">Israel</emphasis> , company law and financial regulations make special provisions for them. However, the provisions come nowhere near the Konzernrecht that is practiced in Germany (and in other European countries) and therefore in some areas might lack coherence (European Commission, 2011a). Company groups are taken into account via accounting and transparency rules and through the definition of directors’ duties and thus a basis for enforcement. </para>
		<para> The review and disclosure regime may be waived for intra-company transactions in <emphasis style="bold">Italy</emphasis> and <emphasis style="bold">Belgium</emphasis> . In <emphasis style="bold">Italy</emphasis> the waiver can apply to subsidiaries and associates provided there is no significant interest by the controlling or other related party (i.e. the cash flow rights are lower in the benefiting company so that there is no rationale for the transaction purely on wealth capture grounds). There is also an opt-out provision from procedures and disclosures regarding transactions in the ordinary course of business and on market terms. When material, they must be notified to the regulator and synthetically described in the half year or annual report so that there is a basis for monitoring policy. </para>
		<para> The issue of company groups is more complex when it comes to defining directors duties that may form the basis for public or private enforcement action. In the case of a single standing company, the duties of loyalty and care to the company are more or less clear and in force in nearly all countries. <footnote xml:id="fn2212">
				<para>The key difference between jurisdictions is more in the nature of whether there is a fiduciary duty which is to act in the best interests of the shareholders and the company. The duty of loyalty is more restricted. </para>
			</footnote> However, a controlling group changes things considerably, especially when a controlling shareholder is acting via a group. Is the duty of loyalty to the individual company or to a wider group? The review of <emphasis style="bold">Belgium</emphasis> references a case where a company transferred money to a failing subsidiary so that shareholders in the parent company that incurred a loss and the market regulator sued directors for breach of loyalty. The court ruled that directors have a duty also to the group under certain conditions. Similar cases are reported for <emphasis style="bold">France</emphasis> . </para>
		<para> In both <emphasis style="bold">France</emphasis> and <emphasis style="bold">Belgium</emphasis> and to some extent <emphasis style="bold">Italy</emphasis> a jurisprudence doctrine has been followed that can be loosely termed the Rozenblum doctrine or a compensation doctrine. The doctrine admits a group defence for directors regarding loyalty if there is: a group characterised by capital links between the companies; there is a strong, effective business integration among the companies of the group; and financial support for one company to another must have an economic quid pro quo and may not break the balance of mutual commitments between the concerned companies; the support from the company must not exceed its possibilities or in other words it should not create a risk of bankruptcy for the company (see Conac et al, 2007, page 519). The question is where does this leave minority rights protection when they are not stockholders in the other company? Where does this leave the duty of loyalty for board members when they must set their duty against a theoretical balance of advantages to the company in the group? For <emphasis style="bold">India</emphasis> and <emphasis style="bold">Israel </emphasis> where directors’ duties are clearly defined in terms of the interests of their companies, the question is somewhat different. How should directors duties be defined when company groups are in fact widespread with strong centralised control. The conflict of interest of board members is not only with respect to their own financial benefit but with respect to centrally run company groups where allocation or denial of opportunities might occur every day. </para>
		<para> While being characterised by widespread company groups, <emphasis style="bold">India</emphasis> and <emphasis style="bold">Israel</emphasis> have made only some provisions in their laws and regulations for them. A certain exception is where IFRS has been adopted: IAS 24 and IAS 27 require disclosure about related parties and the group for consolidation purposes. <emphasis style="bold">India</emphasis> plans to introduce IFRS shortly but domestic standards are already very close to IAS 24. More generally, in the European context one study has noted a lack of transparency: “Although there are numerous and detailed rules on group information, there is no rule requiring an annual report, corporate governance statement or company website to describe the main features of a company’s group structure in a clear and investor-friendly manner. Currently, for example, some companies’ annual reports contain a chapter on changes in group structure without providing information on the existing group structure. It should also be assessed if a list of subsidiaries should be available for stakeholders <emphasis style="italic">” </emphasis> (European Commission 2011a). Normally, intra-group transactions must be described in the annual report, but it might be quite difficult for shareholders to understand the real meaning of such transactions (and to make any judgment if necessary) without any information of a company’s group structure in a clear and investor-friendly manner. <emphasis style="bold">Israel</emphasis> requires disclosure by non-listed companies that are part of a company group. </para>
