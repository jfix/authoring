		<metadata-item property="kim:description" value="The IEA Energy Technology Perspectives Study (ETP) 2008 demonstrates that CCS will need to contribute nearly one-fifth of the necessary emissions reductions to reduce global GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 at a reasonable cost. In the following, starting from an outline of the prospects of CCS based on a scenario analysis with the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) model, an overview of the technology options, their costs and research and development (R&amp;D) challenges for captvalueURIng CO2 in power generation and subsequently transporting and storing is given. The EGC Expert Group is invited to discuss the content of the document in the context of Projected Costs of Generating Electricity and to provide comments to the Secretariat."/>

		<para>Fyffes was a company involved in the banana trade. It found that an employee who negotiated a service agreement with a shipping contractor took bribes amounting to more than USD 1.4 million between 1992 and 1996. Fyffes sought to recover damages from the employee, the shipping company, and its agents. </para>
		<para>All defendants were found jointly liable for the value of the bribes. The court ruled that “there can be no dispute that [the bribes] were taken into account by <emphasis style="italic">the contractor </emphasis> in agreeing the amount of the freight for each year, which would have been correspondingly less for Fyffes if they had only had to pay the net sum which <emphasis style="italic">the contractor </emphasis> were prepared to accept.” The shipping company and its agents were liable to pay additional compensation for the loss that Fyffes suffered from entering into the contract under unfavourable terms. </para>
		<para>To reach this conclusion, the judge rejected an account (a disgorgement) of all profits made by the contractor because it was “highly probable that Fyffes would have entered into a service agreement with the contractor if the employee had not been dishonest.” As a result, “ordinary” profit from the contract was not caused by bribery, but by “the provision of services for which there would have been a contract in any event.” </para>
