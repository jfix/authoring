		<sub-title>Strategic Orientations 2011 and beyond – Framing priorities for the next 50 years</sub-title>
		<para>We are celebrating the OECD’s 50 Anniversary in the aftermath of the worst financial and economic crisis in our lifetime. This is an opportunity to take stock and to question ourselves: Why couldn’t we avoid the crisis? What needs to be done to prevent another crisis? Are our economic theories, our economic models, and our assumptions still appropriate? What adjustments do we need in our mandate in order to fulfil our mission of “better policies for better lives”? </para>
		<para>Simply returning to growth will not be sufficient. We must draw all possible lessons from the crisis. We need to do so against a background of climate change, high unemployment levels, particularly among the youth, increasing inequalities, large fiscal deficits and very high debt accumulation. The economic growth model we should champion must take into account the impact on the environment, its redistributive capacity and the international linkages, via trade, investment and migration. We need to challenge conventional wisdom, including our own, and advance new ways of addressing these issues. We are, after all, the institution that brought the increase in inequality to the attention of policy makers. We are the institution that has designed economic tools to better manage the environment. And we are also the institution that assesses, measures and analyses demographic and migratory changes and policies. So we need to build on our strengths to advance powerful solutions to the challenges we are confronting. </para>
		<para>Indeed, growth remains the key driver for employment and wealth creation. Fair and open markets, competition, and innovation are all critical to growth. But we also need a more inclusive and greener model of growth based on sound institutions. Searching for new sources of growth that are also “green”, more equitable and more “gender friendly” has become our common objective to overcome the effects of the crisis. All these policies have to be linked to employment and job creation. The OECD’s work on employment, education, skills, and social policies has made the Organisation a strong ally of workers and businesses and of all stakeholders interested in job creation, equal opportunities and inclusive participation. This must continue to be the case. Targeted support for the most vulnerable, employment, skills and education to ensure lifelong employability must remain a central focus of our work. We need to address the “E” policy priorities: Employment, Entrepreneurship, Education, Environment and Equality. In order to make this work effective and helpful to our citizens, our call of “going structural” has to be accompanied by a “going social.” As outlined in our recent Social Policy Ministerial, overcoming inequalities by targeted social policies, by family and gender policies, by fostering intergenerational solidarity and by investing in the future of our children, will be crucial ingredients for future growth and development. We must focus even more in our relations with the social partners to reach such joint goals. We will continue to explore ways and develop techniques to monitor the quality of life of our citizens and their level of satisfaction, as well as to assess the performance of our governments in the delivery of public services and public goods. The benefits of an eventual convergence of both strands of work for the quality of public policies are quite obvious. </para>
		<para> The “D” in OECD is about development and it is therefore a strategic priority. The OECD story is about promoting coherent policies for development. In the fight against poverty, in our efforts to meet the MDG’s and to improve the lives of people we must take a broad view and leverage our expertise in several policy areas. We therefore propose to the 50 <sup>th</sup> Anniversary Ministerial meeting to work on a broader OECD strategy for development. </para>
		<para>It is also essential that we exchange knowledge, analysis and advice with our partners in emerging and developing countries. Emerging economies are now the main drivers of global growth, and enhancing our collaboration with them will be mutually-beneficial. Our standards and our experiences, good and bad, can contribute to their thinking and development process. They, in turn, can bring us fresh perspectives and help us address joint global challenges more effectively. Our Enhanced Engagement process has been extremely fruitful. However, to seize the full benefits of this co-operation going forward, we should jointly design better structured, more advanced modalities of work with these economies, within the context of a medium and long-term vision. </para>
		<para>The regional dimension of our work must also be strengthened, including our work with Africa, Latin America, South East Asia, Central Asia, Eurasia, and South East Europe. In the case of our work with MENA, we should now focus on a broader number of policy areas to support the transition. </para>
		<para>Finally, we need to improve our co-operation and coherence with other international organisations and strengthen our support for international fora like the G8 and G20. We could have done better before the crisis if there had been more connectivity, cross-fertilisation and co-operation both among countries and international organisations. Thus, we need to strengthen multilateralism, and create an expanded network of countries and partners to improve policy making and implementation worldwide. This new multilateralism must have an overarching goal – “Better Policies for Better Lives”- and its ultimate target must be the welfare of all citizens. </para>
