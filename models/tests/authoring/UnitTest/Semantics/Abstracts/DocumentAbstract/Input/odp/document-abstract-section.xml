	<section>
		<title>Abstract</title>
		
		<para>In an attempt to contain rising trends in obesity and associated chronic diseases, many governments
		have implemented a range of policies to promote healthy lifestyles. These efforts have been hindered by
		the limited availability of evidence about the effectiveness of interventions in changing lifestyles and
		reducing obesity. Evaluations of the cost-effectiveness and distributional impacts of such interventions are
		even fewer and narrower in terms of numbers of options considered.</para>
		
	<para>	An economic analysis was developed as part of this project, with the aim of strengthening the existing
		evidence-base on the efficiency of interventions to tackle unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles. The
		analysis was undertaken in collaboration with the WHO, broadly based on the WHO-CHOICE (CHOosing
		Interventions that are Cost-Effective) approach. The aim of the analysis is to assess the efficiency of a
		range of policy options to tackle unhealthy lifestyles and related chronic diseases. Additionally, compared
		to the traditional CHOICE framework, the analysis has assessed the distributional impacts of preventive
		strategies on costs and health outcomes. Most of the preventive interventions evaluated as part of the
		project have favourable cost-effectiveness ratios, relative to a scenario in which no systematic prevention is
		undertaken and chronic diseases are treated once they emerge. However, none of the interventions assessed
		in the analysis may significantly reduce the scale of the obesity problem, if implemented in isolation.</para>
	<para>	
		Although the most efficient interventions are found to be outside the health sector, health care systems can
		make the largest impact on obesity and related chronic conditions by focusing on individuals at high risk.
		Interventions targeting younger age groups are unlikely to have any significant health effects at the
		population level for many years. The cost-effectiveness profiles of such interventions may be favourable in
		the long-term, but remain very unfavourable for several decades at the start of the interventions.
		Preventive interventions do not always generate reductions in health expenditure, even when the
		analysis is limited to a set of diseases that are more directly affected by diet, physical activity and obesity.
		Governments should determine what level of resources (budgets) they are willing and able to spend on
		prevention, and they may use the findings of this economic analysis to assess what portfolio of
		interventions would make the best use of such budgets.</para>
