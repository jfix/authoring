		<title>where now for development after three years of crisis?</title>
		<sub-title>Introduction by the Chair of the Development Assistance Committee</sub-title>
		<abstract>
			<para>The combined acute effects of the food, energy and economic crises are a major challenge to the development community, raising searching questions about the real impacts of development, how to demonstrate them, what really underlies them, and our ability to control and account for them.</para>
			<para>In light of these multiple crises, the need for development results has become even more urgent. This chapter asserts that the development community must follow through on its ambitious reform agenda, better document its impact, and make the necessary changes to ensure that development co-operation becomes an effective instrument in managing the challenges of globalisation. The aid effectiveness commitments of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action are the best indications of how seriously the development community is taking these concerns, but progress in achieving them is still too slow. Recent years have demonstrated how global factors beyond aid have a huge impact on development. They have also left no doubt about the importance of development co-operation for tackling new and persisting development challenges. Development co-operation therefore needs to work in numerous policy areas and with the many different actors shaping poor countriesâ€™ development.</para>
			<para>The chapter concludes that in the future the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) will be much more involved with the global aid architecture, with making non-aid policies coherent with development goals, and with global issues like climate change and achieving an equitable world trade system. It will sharpen its policy tools, place greater emphasis on monitoring impacts and holding its members to account, and be much more inclusive and pro-active in working with others.</para>
